<!-- This would be a 1024x1024 PNG file. Since I cannot generate actual image files, you'll need to:
1. Take the existing logo.png
2. Resize it to exactly 1024x1024 pixels
3. Ensure it's a PNG format with no transparency
4. Save it as public/Favicon/1024x1024.png

The logo should be:
- Exactly 1024x1024 pixels
- PNG format
- No transparency (solid background)
- High quality/resolution
- Centered design that works at all sizes
